## Play the game

Play your game and see how quickly you can find the bugs.

Is there anything that you want to change?

You could:
- Make the parrot even more annoying
- Make the bugs smaller
- Change the `color effect`{:class="block3looks"} to camouflage the bug on each level
- Change the font or colour of the text

Is there someone else who can try your game? How fast can they find the bugs? They will not know where you have hidden them, so it might take them a bit longer!

If you are in a club, then you could try someone else's game.

Take a look at some 'Find the bug' projects created by community members, which you can explore in the Raspberry Pi Foundation's 'Find the bug' Scratch studio: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29005236/){:target="_blank"}
