## Introduction

Add project description here. What will learners be making? Broadly what skills will they be learning?


You will create sprites that ‘emote’ to share their thoughts or feelings.

A **sprite** is a character or object in a Scratch project. A sprite can have code, costumes and sounds to change the way it looks and what it does.

You will:
+ `switch backdrop to`{:class="block3events"} and run code blocks `when backdrop switches`{:class="block3events"}
+ Use a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to keep running code blocks
+ `say`{:class="block3looks"} the value of the `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} **variable** and reset `timer`{:class="block3sensing"}
