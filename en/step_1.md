## Introduction

In this project, you will create a game in which you have to find a hidden bug on each level. The game will have 'start' and 'end' screen backdrops and a timer to show how quickly you found the bugs. 

You will:
+ Create levels for your game using `next backdrop`{:class="block3looks"} and `when backdrop switches`{:class="block3events"} blocks
+ Use a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to keep running code blocks
+ Use the `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} **variable** to let the player know how they did

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on the bug to start the game.

Try to find the bug on each level.

How well are the bugs hidden? You will get to add your own levels and make it as easy or difficult as you like.

More than 2.5 billion people play video games every year. Just think how many people are involved in creating those games. Would you like a job designing, coding, or testing games for other people to play?
