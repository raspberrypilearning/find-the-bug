If you are following the [Introduction to Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Googly eye character](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/googly-eye-character) project. In this project, you will design your own googly eye character with eyes that look at the mouse pointer when you move the mouse!
