## Play the game

Have a go at playing your game and see how quickly you can find the bugs. 

--- task ---

Is there anything you want to change?

You could:
- make the parrot even more annoying
- make the bugs smaller 
- change the `color effect`{:class="block3looks"} to camouflage the bug on each level
- change the font or color of the text

Is there someone else you can get to try your game? Get them to try the game and see how fast they can find the bugs. They won't know where you've hidden them so it might take them a bit longer!

If you're in a club then you could try someone else's game. 

<mark>Add studio where they can try out games created by others?

Take a look at some Find the bug projects created by community members, which you can explore in the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s studio of Find the bug Community Projects: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29005236/)
