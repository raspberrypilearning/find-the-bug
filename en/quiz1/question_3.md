legend: Question 3 of 3
---

You added this script to the Bug sprite:

![Bug sprite.](images/bug-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when backdrop switches to [end v]
set size to [100] % 
go to x: [0] y: [30] 
+ say (timer) 
```

How does the `say`{:class="block3looks"} `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} block make the Stage look when the backdrop switches to 'end'?

Have a look at the script again, and think about which sprite is the main character of the game (the parrot is just an annoying distraction).

The `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} block comes from the `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"} blocks menu; it does not say the word "timer". Also, think about which sprite uses this code.

Yes, the `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} block reports the time since the project started, or since the timer reset.
